It is assumed that\r\n\r\nevery person who attends one of our events can write and understand some form of programming\r\n\r\nor scripting language. However, it is completely inevitable that young people with less technical skill\r\n\r\nwill come along to the centre during the week.\r\n\r\nAs a mentor, we would also suggest that you use the following two activities to help aid less-skilled\r\n\r\nparticipants in learning the basics.\r\n\r\n> Intro to Web Development\r\n\r\nTo help newbies get started with the basics in HTML, CSS and Javascript, we have put together an\r\n\r\nintroductory exercise that can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.yrs.io/get-started\r\n\r\nThe step-by-step format should allow for young people to work through the exercise without\r\n\r\nconstant supervision, giving you the freedom to move between groups.\r\n\r\n> Ruby’s Threads\r\n\r\nAnother exercise that can help when catering for skills gaps is our community project, Ruby’s\r\n\r\nThreads:\r\n\r\nhttp://rb.yrs.io\r\n\r\nWe have put all the code in our GitHub account ready for participants to fork and play around with.\r\n\r\nThis is a great exercise to introduce even your more advanced coders to GitHub:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/youngrewired/rubys-threads\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn:\r\n\r\n● How to setup git on your computer\r\n\r\n● How to change 'branches' in git\r\n\r\n● How to make changes to the project\r\n\r\n● How to push your changes back up to GitHub\r\n\r\n● How to submit a pull request on GitHub\r\n\r\nWe’d love to see a Ruby designed for each Festival of Code centre. Perhaps ‘designing a centre\r\n\r\nRuby’ is an exercise the whole centre can get involved with on day one, allowing for easier\r\n\r\nintegration of newbies.\r\n\r\nOnce your participants have completed the above two exercises and are feeling more confident\r\n\r\nwith code, it’s time to integrate them with the rest of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tips \r\n* Make sure your hack has not been done before (YRS hack pages, Google)\r\n\r\n## Winning Categories\r\n* Best example of code - really awesome code\r\n* Best example of design - intuitive, beautiful, interactive & works\r\n* Code a better country - a civic tech hack, something for the benefit of your family, friends, community or country\r\n* Should Exist - something that everyone would use if it existed\r\n* Best in show - all of the above\r\n* Peoples choice award - anyone can vote\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
